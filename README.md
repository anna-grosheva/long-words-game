# Long Words Game

## How to play
1. Two players try to type an existing long English word putting letters one by one to the line. The first letter is randomly defined.
2. At every step of the game players must know what word they have in mind.
3. Each player can put only one letter at once in any place: before, after or between the written letters.
4. It can be any letter of the planned word: let’s say, if there’s PR in the line and the player thinks about the word PRODUCTION, so it’s not necessary to put O next, moreover, it’s recommended to use any other letters of the word to make the game for your rival harder (PRU for example).
5. After putting a new letter, the player clicks “Submit” to pass the game to another player.
6. Players take turns and add letters. For example:
```
Player1: H (in mind: HOT)
Player2: U H (in mind: PUSH)
Player1: U C H (in mind: PUNCH)
Player2: L U C H (in mind: LUNCH)
Player1: L U C H E (in mind: LUNCHEON)
etc.
```
The aim is to type the longest word you can recall in order to get more points.
If at any point of the game one of the players (Player1) doesn’t know any existing word with a written letter combination, he/she clicks “Give up” and another player (Player2) takes turn.
After it Player2 has a chance to type fully the word he/she has in mind and check it in the dictionary (the button “Check the word”):
**a)** if the word exists (the green check mark appears), Player2 wins and gets as much points as letters in the checked word;
**b)** if there’s no such word in the dictionary (the red cross appears), Player1 wins instead and gets all points.
If both players give up one by one, then it’s a draw and none of them get points.
Click “Next Round” to start a new round.
The player who has more points starts the new round.
